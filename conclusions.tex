\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

In this paper, we propose a new architecture called MOVAD for the online frame-level Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) task.
It is capable to work in a real time guaranteed response times and online fashion, handling the most restrictive VAD scenario.
MOVAD is composed by a short-term memory, which extracts information related to the ongoing action, implemented by a Video Swin Transformer adapted to work in a online scenario, and a long-term memory module that considers remote past information thanks to LSTM.
We evaluated its performance on Detection of Traffic Anomaly (DoTA) dataset, a collection of dash-mounted camera videos of accidents, reaching $82.11\%$ AUC, surpassing the current state of the art by +$2.81$ AUC.
